HOWTO BUILD
-----------

1. bootstrap:
   In a fresh CVS co directory (cvs co IBMgtSim) you need to run ./config/bootstrap
   Make sure the autoconf -V is version 2.59 or newer.

2. configure:
   ./configure --with-osm=<opensm install path> --prefix=<where ever you want> 

   Optionally you can add:
   --enable-debug --enable-maintainer-mode 

   If there there is no IBDM installed on the machine you will need to provide:
   --with-ibdm=<where ever you did install it>

   NOTE: the pointer to the osm install path can be to any osm (not just the one 
   supporting the simulator. e.g. /usr
   
   Example:
    ./configure --enable-debug --enable-maintainer-mode \
        --with-osm=/home/eitan/SW/osm/linuxuser/bin/x86/2.6.5/debug \
        --prefix=/home/eitan/SW/cvsroot/IBMgtSim/usr \
        --with-ibdm=/home/eitan/SW/ibadm_build/usr

3. make:
   export PATH=$PATH://mswg/projects/ibadm/BINS/i686/bin

   simply 'make'

4. install:
   make install

5. run the server:
   setenv IBMGTSIM_DIR <some dir used by the server and its clients>
   set path = ($path <prefix>/bin)
   usr/bin/IBMgtSim -t <topology-file> 
   See more options using -h.

6. create some dummy /proc file system for some nodes:
   usr/bin/mkSimNodeDir -n <host-name(H-1)> -g $IBMGTSIM_DIR/ibmgtsim.guids.txt

7. to run OpenSM with the simulator:
   OpenSM with support for a special vendor - i.e. the simulator
   should be built separatly. To do that you need to provide the 
   -b sim to the OpenSM install script and also define IBMGTSIMHOME
   pointing to the prefix where the simulator was installed (above the bin
   dir). 

   setenv IBMGTSIM_DIR <some dir used by the server and its clients>
   setenv IBMGTSIM_NODE <one of the node names you generated /proc for>

   Invoke OpenSM ...
