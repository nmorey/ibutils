This directory holds some tcl code of simulator tests, and 
example topology files.

RunSimTest TESTS:
------------------
osmLidAssignment - comprehensive test of lid assignment algorithm
osmMulticastRoutingTest - performs Multicast Join in random order
osmStability - check if we can get Subnet Up under many bad links
OsmTest - simply run osmtest after subnet is up

RunSimTest requires two files: 
* a "simulator flow": *.sim.tcl file that is run in the simulator
* a "checker": *.check.tcl file that extends the RunSimTest with
  a particular flow of execution and checkers for pass/fail

OTHERS:
_______
init.test.tcl - is a very simple code that only initialize
  the simulator and serve as example for the TCL API.

TOPOLOGY FILES:
---------------
Gnu16NodeOsmTest.topo - a 6 x 8p switch, two level tree with 16 nodes
ReindeerBased128Nodes.topo - 128 nodes on 2 level tree made out of 24p switches
RhinoBased10K.topo - a 10,000 nodes tree made of 24p (first) and 144p (second)
RhinoBased512Nodes.topo - 512 ndoes tree using 144p switches (have credit loops)
RhinoBasedCreditLoop.topo - 3 24p switch and 1 144p switch for credit loop demo
RhinoReindeer1100.topo - a 10K nodes cluster made of 24p and 144p switches
