IBDM Topology File
------------------

The topology file describes the IB connectivity and systems included in the cluster. 
It serves two purposes:
1. Support for arbitrary system names to be later used in every report
   that IBDM generates. 
2. Connectivity verification: The specified cluster topology is
   verified against the discovered one. Mismatch errors resulting from
   missing cables and/or wrong connections are reported by IBADM. 

The topology file is composed "system" sections. Each such section
describes the connectivity of one system to other systems in the
cluster. The first line of each section is a declaration of the system
composed of a system-type, its local system-name section, and optional
configuration details. The lines to follow until the next empty line
describe the connections between the local system ports to the other
systems. The following is a formal definition of a system section
syntax. 

An example is listed afterwards. 

SYSTEM-TYPE LOCAL-SYSTEM-NAME [CFG: <board Name>=<modifier>, [<board Name>=<modifier>]...]
	LOCAL-PORT-PANEL-NAME -> REM-SYS-TYPE REM-SYS-NAME REM-PORT-PANEL-NAME
	LOCAL-PORT-PANEL-NAME -> REM-SYS-TYPE REM-SYS-NAME REM-PORT-PANEL-NAME
	LOCAL-PORT-PANEL-NAME -> REM-SYS-TYPE REM-SYS-NAME REM-PORT-PANEL-NAME
	. . .

SYSTEM-TYPE LOCAL-SYSTEM-NAME [CFG: <board Name>=<modifier>, [<board Name>=<modifier>]...]
	LOCAL-PORT-PANEL-NAME -> REM-SYS-TYPE REM-SYS-NAME REM-PORT-PANEL-NAME
	LOCAL-PORT-PANEL-NAME -> REM-SYS-TYPE REM-SYS-NAME REM-PORT-PANEL-NAME
	. . .
. . .

Where:

SYSTEM-TYPE = REM-SYS-TYPE = Any system that has a corresponding IBNL
definition.

LOCAL-SYSTEM-NAME = the name of the system described in this topology
    file section. 

LOCAL-PORT-PANEL-NAME = a name of the local system port. The numbers
    printed on the front panel are used together with L<N> for Leaf no. N
    or S<N> for Spine no. N. 

REM-SYS-NAME = the name of the system connected to the local port.

REM-PORT-PANEL-NAME = a name of the remote system port. We use the
    numbers as printed on the front panel and L<N> for Leaf number N or
    S<N> for Spine number N. 

Example: The following is a topology file for a simple cluster:

MTS2400 S-1
   P1 -> MT23108 H-1 P1
   P2 -> MT23108 H-1 P2
   P24 -> MT23108 H-2 P1

The optional CFG: section in the system declaration line describes the
special customization of each board of the system. 

That is the CFG string is a set of comma-separated sub-fields. Each
sub-field describes some special configuration of a corresponding
system board. The actual semantics of the specific board modifiers is 
defined by the IBNL of the specific system.

Example:
The following is an example of a definition-line in a topology file of
the MTS9600 switch system. This switch system can have up to eight
leafs and four spines. This example of the MTS9600 lacks (R) leafs
no.6,7 and 8, and lacks spines no. 3 and 4. 

MTS9600 PartialGz1 CFG: leaf3=R,leaf5=R,leaf7=R,spine1=R
