                             FABRIC UTILS 
                            --------------

This package provides a set of utilities that is based on a common 
data model to hold a complete fabric at both the system and node levels.

fabric_sim:
-----------
Provide means to define a fabric from a cabling scheme file holding
both cables definition and systems types. Then it runs OpenSM like
algorithm for LID assignment, MinHOP  tables generation and finally 
routing. Some statistics are provided. The fabric is checked for 
credit loops that might cause dead locks.

E.g.: 
fabric_sim -v Clusters/FullCbbTwoSpines.cables H1/U1000 1

fabric_tr: 
-----------
Traces a direct route through the fabric while printing the path
information at both node and system levels.

E.g.: 
fabric_tr Clusters/VaTech.cables OSM/U1000 1 0,1,5,5,2,3,4,5,5,1,3,3,5,5,6,4,1


osm_check:
-----------
Checks some OpenSM routing attributes.
Given OpenSM fdb file (default /tmp/osm.fdbs) and subnet links file 
(/tmp/subnt.lst) - trace routes from every CA to every othr CA.
Also analyze the fabric routing for credit loops.

E.g.: 
osm_check -s Clusters/subnet.lst -f Clusters/osm.fdbs
